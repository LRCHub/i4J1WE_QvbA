Here we go!
We are melting inside
And we're burning
Yeah, we're burning together
This light is invading on our souls
While we're spreading out the gold
At the speed of light

Red!
Gold!
We're born in resonance
Red!
Gold!
Shine like a thousand suns
Red!
Gold!
Burn up inside of me
Red!
Gold!
We'll never stop until we're falling into pieces

I become the world
When I breed without a soul
Until the end of all we melt in red and gold
But we're burning stronger

Let's go!
We are melting inside
And we're burning
Yeah, we're burning together
My soul is swelling up in the air
And it's spreading color red
At the speed of light
Go!

Red!
Gold!
Burn up inside of me
Red!
Gold!
Shine like a thousand suns

I become the world
When I breed without a soul
Until the end of all we melt in red and gold
But we're burning stronger
I become the world
I become the world (I become, I become, I become!)
Until the end of all we melt in red and gold
But we're burning stronger.
