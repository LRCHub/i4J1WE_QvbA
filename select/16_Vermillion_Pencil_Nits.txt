(Hofstede)
Your picture on a wall
I can see it
It's too small
Your picture
On a wall
Cannot touch it
Hold it closer now
Now I'm waiting on your doorstep
One of the objects
You cannot win you cannot have
I am standing in the greenhouse
Among the apples
You cannot see you cannot smell
Your picture on a wall
I can see it
It's too small
The simple little things
I understand
I can feel it
Hold it closer now
Now I'm headstrong and I wonder
One of the objects
You cannot touch you cannot feel
The vermillion pencil
Is in the right hand
The colours I like
I understand
