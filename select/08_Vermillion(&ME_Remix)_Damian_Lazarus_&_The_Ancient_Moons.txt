I know you've been here so long you're really starting to get down
So much you wanted to hide yourself from being found
Crouch down on the desert floor if you're as plastered to the ground
You're used to being all by yourself and safe and sound

Mmm...

I know you've heard it before but soon the sun is gonna rise
You thought you were gonna die before blood orange skies
So sick of moving your body to a well polished life

Well, I got something to move ya, move ya-hah

Bazthe on your back, the scarlet washes away scars
And lets your darkness disappear beneath the stars
Follow the hollow inside you deciding who you are
The sky is nearing vermillion, with nod to fire

I know you've been here so long you're really starting to get down

And lets your darkness disappear beneath the stars
